"""Shared CC billing-cycle window.

A bill-payment credit belongs to the statement cycle it clears. A payment dated
``D`` clears the bill whose due date is the earliest due date on/after ``D`` —
you pay the bill that is next coming due. So the cycle for a statement due on
``this_due`` is the range ``(prev_due, this_due]``: after the prior bill was due,
up to and including this bill's due date. The latest cycle keeps an open upper
edge so a late payment still counts.

This is expressed as the half-open range ``[prev_due + 1 day, this_due + 1 day)``
so one predicate can place every row. The boundary between two consecutive
statements is a single value derived once (``boundary``), so adjacent cycles
never overlap or leave a gap — even when a due date is unreadable or two
statements share a due date (a duplicate re-send: the payment still lands in
exactly one cycle, never both).

Only statements that carry a parseable due date anchor a boundary. A
password-required or parse-error upload has no due date; it must not act as a
cycle edge, or it would strand a payment (and recreate the very bug this fixes).

An earlier version anchored the window on ``created_at`` (the ingestion time, a
proxy for the generation date). A bill paid in the gap between generation and a
late ingestion fell outside its own cycle, so an already-paid statement showed
unpaid and reminded.

Known limitation: ``payment_paid_amount`` is a stored value, recomputed only
when triggered. When a new statement moves an old cycle's upper edge, a LATE
payment that was applied to the old (then-latest) cycle now belongs to the new
one, but the old cycle is not auto-recomputed, so its stored paid amount can go
stale. This only touches a superseded statement's own display and historical
snapshot — the latest cycle (which drives reminders and net-worth) is correct.
A safe auto-fix needs a "manually paid" marker to avoid reverting a manual Mark
as Paid, so it is deferred.
