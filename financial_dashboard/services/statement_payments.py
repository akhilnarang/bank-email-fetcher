"""Payment view-model for the CC statement detail page.

The statement page shows three things for one CC cycle:
- a payment-status line (paid / total / remaining),
- the real credit transactions received against the cycle (settled), and
- provisional bill-payment SMS not yet in the ledger (pending), each with a
  manual "settle" action.

A provisional CC-payment SMS is notify-only in the pipeline: it makes no
Transaction row. So the pending set is not a stored table. It is derived live
by re-parsing the account's unlinked SMS in the cycle window and keeping the
ones the parser calls a provisional credit. Once a row settles it links to a
Transaction and drops off the pending set on its own. This is deliberately
self-healing: no staging table to clean up.
